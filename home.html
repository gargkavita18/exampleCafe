Chandigarh, with its quiet lanes that adhere perfectly to plan, creates a surface image that may surprise those who don’t know that people here love to party - and how! By day a hotbed of strategies and systems, which gives way by night to parties galore, the city seamlessly transitions between the two every day.
<p>
Sector 7 Social, the first ever Social Outlet at Chandigarh, fits right into this blend of Work X Play. The design elements at this space aren’t just quirky, but incredibly functional, which lends itself to a space that is ideal for both.
It is the best place to chill with friends and family.

Sector7Social is here to make sure everything goes according to plan - whether that’s to get some work, done or party through the night!</p>
<p><h2>This weekend's special brunch</h2></p>
<p>This weekend our season of special brunches continues with scrambled eggs on an English muffin. The secret of these eggs is that thay are made with half cheese and cooked with butter.<p>
